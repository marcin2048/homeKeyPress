The reason for this application is missing keyboard functionality on DELL laptops.
For programmers this is important to have HOME/END keys easily accessible.
Because DELL does not have FN+arrow combination keys, I build app for simmilar activity.

Function:
You can not detect if FN key is pressed, so I programmed CTRL DOWN + CTRL UP + ARROW sequence
to make HOME / END action.

To send HOME:
CTRL DOWN, CTRL UP, Left Arrow Down

TO send END:
CTRL DOWN, CTRL UP, Right Arrow Down
